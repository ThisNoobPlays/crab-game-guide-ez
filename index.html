            <h1>Crab Game Introduction</h1>
            <p>Crab Game is a <em>free</em> multiplayer game where you compete in short, fun minigames to try and be the last one standing.</p>

            <p>One game normally starts with a maximum of 20 players, and in each game, some players are eliminated, and the rest move on to the next game. Eventually, there will be a final winner (<i>or maybe 0 if fate befalls you</i>).
            </p>
            <p>The minigames include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tag - Avoid having the stick by tagging other people with it</li>
                <li>Bomb Tag - Pass the bomb to someone else so you don't explode!</li>
                <li>Hide and Seek - Run away from the seekers, or if you are a seeker, stab somebody before the game ends!</li>
                <li>Race - Be the first to complete an obstacle course</li>
                <li>Block Drop - Try not to get crushed by falling blocks!</li>
                <li class="li-exclude-style">And much, much more!</li>

            </ul>

            <p>If you can't find it there, open Steam, Click on "Library" at the top, click "Crab Game" on the left sidebar, and then click the green "Play" button.</p>

            <p>If there is a popup asking you something about Proximity Voice Chat, set it to <b>Push to Talk</b>.</p>
            <p>Click on "Find Game" to bring up a list of active <em>servers</em>. A server is basically one "room" of players. Click "Join" on a server that is in the Lobby. That way, you won't have to wait for the previous game to finish.</em>

            <p>When you load in, you spawn in the <em>Lobby</em>, which is where players wait while the game has not actually started yet.</p>
            <p>Use WASD to move, Shift to run, and Spacebar to jump. <sub class="tooltip" title="W to walk forward, A to walk left, S to walk backward, and D to walk right">confused?</sub></p>
            <p>When you are ready, go up to the middle of the lobby and find the red button. Press E to activate it, which will count you as "ready." When most of the players are ready, a countdown will appear at the top, and the game will start.</p>

            <p>Read the instructions before each minigame to see how to play it. </p>
            <p>Once you are a little familiar with how the game works, you can continue to the next sections to gain more information that is helpful for beginners.

            <h1>How Servers Work</h1>
            <p>You might have noticed the "Start Game" button on the home screen. That is actually where you can create your own server.</p>
            <h2>What are Servers?</h2>
            <p>A server is a computer that is <em>hosting</em> a Crab Game room. When you join a specific server, your computer is connecting to the server computer and sending it lots of data such as your player position and where you're looking. The server
                computer takes in all of the data from all of the connected players and processes it before sending an output data back to your computer. </p>
            <p>This is how you can see where other players are. Because that other player's computer is sending their position data to the server, which is then processing it and sending it back out to all the players so all the players can see where that
                player is. </p>
            <h2>Hosting your own Game</h2>
            <p>Instead of joining someone else's server, you can host your own server on your own computer and let other people join you. This is actually very easy and all you have to do is click the "Start Game" button on the home screen. This brings you
                to a menu where you can set the server name, the max players, the lobby type, and the minigames that should be allowed.</p>
            <p>The lobby type is an important option:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Public</dt>
                <dd>Your server will be listed in the "Find Game" section and anybody can join your server</dd>
                <dt>Friends Only</dt>
                <dd>Only your friends on Steam can see your game and join it</dd>
                <dt>Lobby Code Only</dt>
                <dd>Your server will not be listed in the "Find Game" section. You have to copy the lobby code and manually give it to people who you want to join your server. This is useful for creating a private lobby with your friends.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>The rest of the options are pretty self-explanatory.</p>
