            <h1>Crab Game Introduction</h1>
            <p>Crab Game is a <em>free</em> multiplayer game where you compete in short, fun minigames to try and be the last one standing.</p>

            <p>One game normally starts with a maximum of 20 players, and in each game, some players are eliminated, and the rest move on to the next game. Eventually, there will be a final winner (<i>or maybe 0 if fate befalls you</i>).
            </p>
            <p>The minigames include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tag - Avoid having the stick by tagging other people with it</li>
                <li>Bomb Tag - Pass the bomb to someone else so you don't explode!</li>
                <li>Hide and Seek - Run away from the seekers, or if you are a seeker, stab somebody before the game ends!</li>
                <li>Race - Be the first to complete an obstacle course</li>
                <li>Block Drop - Try not to get crushed by falling blocks!</li>
                <li class="li-exclude-style">And much, much more!</li>

            </ul>
