            <h1>Performance Optimization</h1>
            <p>In order to have the best competitive advantage, you need to ensure your game is running smoothly and with minimal lag. </p>
            <p>In this article, I will show you some things that you can do to improve game performance, and I recommend you do all of them to have the best performance.

            </p>
            <h2>In-Game Graphics Settings</h2>
            <p>The most direct way to improve your performance is just to set all the graphics options to their lowest options, which will reduce the load on your GPU and increase your
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate">FPS</a>.</p>
            <p>If you think the graphics look too bad, just incrementally increase the graphics settings until you strike a good quality-to-performance balance.</p>
            <h2>Forcing DirectX 12 (Windows only)</h2>
            <p>If you play on Windows, Crab Game defaults to using the DirectX 11 rendering engine. However, if your Windows and graphics drivers are of the latest version, you can force the game to use DirectX 12, bringing about a significant FPS boost.</p>
            <p>If you have not updated your Windows or your
                <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/135976/how-to-update-your-graphics-drivers-for-maximum-gaming-performance/">graphics drivers</a>, do this before proceeding.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open Steam</li>
                <li>Go to "Library" at the top</li>
                <li>On the left, find the Crab Game entry, right click it, and click "Properties"</li>
                <li>Where it says Launch Options, type in exactly (without the quotes) : "-force-d3d12"</li>
                <li>Relaunch the game</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You should see a marked performance boost. If your game crashes or experiences problems, just get rid of the text in the launch options section.</p>
            <h2>Network Optimization</h2>
            <p>Your internet affects your in-game latency and responsiveness. There are some things that you can do to decrease latency/ping.</p>
            <p>The most important thing that you can do is use ethernet (connecting to internet with a cable). This gets rid of annoying problems with WiFi such as interference and spotty connection. Plus, it reduces the latency between your computer and the WiFi router to a minimum.  </p>
            <p>If you cannot use ethernet, check if your WiFi router supports broadcasting at 5GHz. If it does, and your computer is capable, make sure you connect to the WiFi using 5GHz frequency. This reduces interference and improves speed. If you don't know how to do this, search online for a guide for your specific platform.</p>
            <p>While you're at it, make sure to update your WiFi / Ethernet drivers to their latest version from their manufacturer's website. For example, if my computer uses the Intel AC-8265 wifi card, I go to the downloads page on Intel for that specific chip.</p>
            <p>Finally, you can tweak the advanced settings of your network card driver to potentially reduce latency or get a more stable connection. If you don't know what you're doing, don't touch it as you might break your internet. </p>
