            <h1>Minigame Strategies</h1>
            <p>Here I list some strategies that I use for specific minigames</p>
            <h2>Block Drop</h2>
            <p>Stay close to the inner corners (the ones that touch 3 other blocks), where you can quickly access all 4 squares around you, giving you more time to react to a block dropping.</p>
        <h2>Hat King</h2>
        <p>If you start with the hat, just hide somewhere and it is very likely that no one will ever find you since the other players are focused on chasing more visible hat wearers.</p>
        <p>If you don't have the hat, try your best (use diagonal bunnyhopping).</p>
    <h2>Stepping Stones</h2>
    <p>If you get the small version of this minigame with only 3 rows of stones, you can skip 1 or 2 stones so that you only need to make 2 or 1 landings to get to the end.</p>
    <p>Do this by diagonal jumping. First, diagonal jump to the middle row. Then, if you are capable, you can diagonal jump all the way to the finish, but if you can't, just jump normally to the last row.</p>
    <p>Doing this also decreases your risk of dying (given nobody else has died) from 87.5% to 50% (2 landings) or 33% (1 landing).</p>    
    <h2>Floor is Lava</h2>
    <p>Try to keep yourself on stones that are well-connected to other stones. This means that a stone fully surrounded by other stones is very good, but a stone that only has a connection to one other stone is very bad. </p>
    <p>This gives you more options on where to jump if your stone or some of the connected stones crumble.</p>
