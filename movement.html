            <h2>Diagonal Bunnyhop</h2>
            <p>Whenever you sprint, you should sprint like this.</p>
            <p>First, practice running diagonally by pressing W and A or W and D at the same time. Make sure that you are comfortable running in the direction of straight forward but moving diagonally.</p>
            <p>The next step is to jump continuously while running diagonally. As soon as you land, press space to jump again while keeping your momentum.</p>
            <p>By doing this, you can move magnitudes faster than someone just running straight forward. </p>
            <h2>Diagonal Ladder Climb</h2>
            <p>Whenever climbing ladders, climb diagonally by pressing W and A or W and D, as this is faster than just climbing by pressing W.</p>   
            <h2>Diagonal Jump</h2>
            <p>If you need to make a large jump, you should use diagonal jumping.</p>
            <p>This is where you jump diagonally by pressing W and A or W and D, and right before you jump, you shake your mouse back and forward again to give yourself a momentum boost. </p>
            <p>This does take some practice to get the maximum possible distance.</p>
            <h2>Sliding</h2>
            <p>You can slide in Crab Game by holding C while moving. </p>
            <p>This is very useful when going down a slope, because when you slide, you gain lots of speed. Additionally, you can even slide against a wall, letting you gain a little bit of speed or nullify fall damage.</p>
